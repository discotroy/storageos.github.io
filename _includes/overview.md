# StorageOS Documentation

This documentation is aimed at architects, DevOps engineers, developers,
sysadmins and anybody who wants to understand how to use StorageOS. It assumes
some knowledge of Docker containers and orchestrators.

Start by [understanding the architecture]({% link
_docs/concepts/architecture.md %}) and [playing with a demo](http://play.storageos.com/main).

Once you are ready to install on your cluster, make sure the [prerequisites are
fulfilled]({% link _docs/introduction/quickstart.md %}) and then follow the
installation guides for [Kubernetes]({% link _docs/kubernetes/install-1.10.md %}),
[OpenShift]({% link _docs/openshift/install-3.8.md %}) or [Docker]({% link
_docs/docker/install.md %}).

When you want to run StorageOS in production, read about [best practices]({% link
_docs/concepts/production.md %}).
