# Troubleshooting

## Installation issues

``` Error response from daemon: dial unix
/run/docker/plugins/a-very-long-hash-value/storageos.sock: connect: connection
refused ```

This error indicates that the StorageOS did not successfully start during
installation. This is usually due to incorrect option values being passed to the
docker plugin installation command.

Common causes of this issue are

- Missing or invalid `JOIN` information
- Inability to contact the StorageOS [discovery
  service]({%link _docs/prerequisites/clusterdiscovery.md %})
  (when using a cluster token)
- Missing `-v /run/docker/plugins:/run/docker/plugins`

Refer to the [container install instructions]({%link _docs/docker/install.md
%}), or run `docker logs storageos` for more debug output.


## Clearing cached `JOIN`

When trying out StorageOS in Dev/POC environments it is common to change the
value of the `JOIN` variable between installs. However, if a cluster has
previously been made, the old `JOIN` value is cached and used
in preference. When re-installing StorageOS, you should clear the
old cached data:

```
$ rm -rf /var/lib/storageos*
```

Note this will remove any data stored on this node.

## Re-using an old cluster token

When re-installing StorageOS it is possible to make the mistake of using an old
cluster token from a previous install. This will cause the new StorageOS install
to attempt to join the old cluster, normally resulting in a failure.

```
$ docker plugin install --alias storageos storageos/plugin:0.9.2 JOIN=$PREVIOUS_CLUSTER_ID
