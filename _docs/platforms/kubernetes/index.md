# Kubernetes

This section of documentation covers use of the vanilla [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) orchestrator. The StorageOS installation procedure is slightly different depending on the version you have deployed, so follow the appropriate guide. Other documents in this section are version agnostic.

We support Kubernetes versions 1.7 and upwards.
